Custom Helpers using .net Razor engine

The folder "CustomHelper" it's the project, and "CustomHelpersDemo" it's the demo web, to test the Helpers.

This helpers are compatible with IE6/IE7/IE8/IE9/Mozilla/Chrome.


The magic of this Helpers, are the server and client validation, that it's automatic, using DataAnnotations.
To client validation we use a "CustomHelper.js" that validate, and also create a mask to block invalid characters.
